# Sessions overview

This part of the site gives a clear roadmap for the three AI training sessions at New Roc.

Together, the sessions move from getting comfortable with AI on real project work, to using AI agents to organize information and updates, and finally to applying these habits inside each team's day‑to‑day workflows.

## Session 1 – AI for everyday project work

Use AI as a helper on real specs, emails, and contracts.
