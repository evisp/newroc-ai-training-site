# Session 1 - AI for everyday project work

The goal of this session is to help you use AI to handle project information faster and more clearly, without changing your main tools.

You'll see AI answer real project questions, learn a simple 5-step way to ask for help, and then try it yourself on examples that look like your own jobs.

## What’s in this session

- Big picture: [What AI can and can't do](ai-fundamentals.md)  
- The core habit we’ll reuse: [5-step prompting pattern](5-step-pattern.md)  
- How it looks in practice: [Live demos](demos.md)  
- Time to try it yourself: [Practice & exercises](exercises.md)

> Small AI habits in your daily work add up to big time savings on every project.
