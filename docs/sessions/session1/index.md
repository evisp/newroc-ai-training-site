# Session 1 - AI for everyday project work

The goal of this session is to help you use AI to handle project information faster and more clearly, without changing your main tools.

You'll see AI answer real project questions, learn a simple 5-step way to ask for help, and then try it yourself on examples that look like your own jobs.

**Start here (10 minutes):** Read the fundamentals → learn the 5-step pattern → try one exercise.

## What you’ll be able to do after Session 1

- Find answers in long specs and contracts without reading everything.
- Turn one spec section into a checklist or table you can reuse.
- Verify results in the PDF and save them with a source link.

## What’s in this session

- Big picture: [What AI can and can't do](ai-fundamentals.md)
- The core habit we'll reuse: [5-step prompting pattern](5-step-pattern.md)
- How it looks in practice: [Live demos](demos.md)
- Time to try it yourself: [Practice & exercises](exercises.md)

> Small AI habits in your daily work add up to big time savings on every project.
