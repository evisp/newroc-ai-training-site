# Session 1 - AI for everyday project work

Use AI to move faster through specs, contracts, and emails **without guessing** and without changing your main tools.

You will practice one repeatable method: extract a small section, ask for a useful output, verify it in the PDF, then save it with a source link so it can be reused and defended later.

!!! info "Start here (10 minutes)"
    Read the fundamentals → learn the 5-step pattern → pick one demo or exercise.

!!! warning "Golden rule for Session 1"
    **No reference = not usable.** If the output doesn’t point to the clause/section/page, verify in the PDF or treat it as a draft only.

## The method we will repeat

- Extract: Work from one spec/contract section at a time (not the full book).
- Prompt: Use the 5-step pattern (Task, Context, Constraints, Output format, Verification).
- Verify: Spot-check 2–3 items in the PDF using the cited references.
- Save: Store the verified result where work lives, with a source link and any “Not stated / missing inputs.”

!!! success "What you should leave with"
    - 1 reusable prompt (copy/paste).
    - 1 verified output (checklist or table) with section/page references.
    - 1 saved note that includes the prompt, output, and source link.

## What you'll be able to do after Session 1

- Find answers in long specs and contracts without reading everything end-to-end.
- Turn one spec section into a checklist or table you can reuse.
- Verify results in the PDF and save them with a source link.
