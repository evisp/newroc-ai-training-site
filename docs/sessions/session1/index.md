# Session 1 - AI for everyday project work

Use AI to move faster through specs, contracts, and emails **without guessing** and without changing your main tools.  

You will practice one repeatable method: extract a small section, ask for a useful output, verify it in the PDF, then save it with a source link so it can be reused and defended later.  

**Start here (10 minutes):** Read the fundamentals → learn the 5-step pattern → pick one demo or exercise.    

## The method we will repeat

- Extract: Work from one spec/contract section at a time (not the full book).
- Prompt: Use the 5-step pattern (Task, Context, Constraints, Output format, Verification).
- Verify: Spot-check 2–3 items in the PDF using the cited references.
- Save: Store the verified result where work lives, with a source link and any “Not stated / missing inputs.”  

## What you'll be able to do after Session 1

- Find answers in long specs and contracts without reading everything end-to-end.
- Turn one spec section into a checklist or table you can reuse.
- Verify results in the PDF and save them with a source link.

- Big picture: [What AI can and can't do](ai-fundamentals.md)
- The core habit we’ll reuse: [5-step prompting pattern](5-step-pattern.md)
- See it on real sections: [Live demos](demos.md)
- Do it yourself: [Practice & exercises](exercises.md)
