# AI at Work for New Roc

AI is joining your day-to-day work at New Roc to make handling information easier, not harder.  
This page explains, in plain terms, what AI is good for, where it struggles, and how we'll use it in this training.

## Why this matters for New Roc

On most projects, a lot of time goes into reading and re-reading specs, contracts, emails, and logs just to find the few lines that matter.  
AI can help you search, summarise, and organise this information faster, while you stay in control of the decisions.

In this training, **AI is treated as a helper inside tools you already know** (browser, PDF viewer, email, Excel), *not as a new system you have to learn* from scratch.


## What AI is (in simple words)

Think of AI as a **very fast assistant** that has learned from many examples how people write and respond.  
You give it some text and a clear task, and it tries to produce a helpful answer in words, lists, or tables.

Some examples in a construction context:

- Pointing you to likely places in a spec where a requirement is described.  
- Summarising a long email thread into a short list of decisions and open questions.  
- Turning rough notes into clear bullets you can paste into minutes or a log.


## What AI is good at in project work

AI is most useful when the task is about reading, rephrasing, and structuring text.

Typical `good at` areas:

**Reading and rephrasing**

- Summaries such as "Spec at a glance" for a section.  
- Simple explanations of clauses in plain language.
- Rewriting emails to be shorter and clearer.

**Structuring information**

- Turning parts of a spec into a table (item, section, notes).  
- Listing submittals, RFIs, or actions from raw text.  
- Grouping similar items together (e.g., similar line items from a takeoff export).

**Drafting first versions**

- Draft email updates based on bullet points or a table.  
- Draft scope notes or transmittal notes to be checked and edited.  
- Draft short summaries for meeting notes or weekly digests.

A useful way to see it: **AI is like a fast junior assistant that works with text**. It drafts and organises; you review and decide.

## What AI is not good at (and common pitfalls)

**AI can sound confident even when it is wrong or unsure**.  
Knowing where it struggles helps you use it safely.

Common weak spots:

**Confident mistakes on details**  

  It can get numbers, dates, and clause references wrong, especially in long or complex documents.

**Mixing old and new information**  

  If the context is not clear (which version, which project), AI may mix up outdated notes with current requirements.

**Ambiguous or missing information**  

  When a spec is vague or silent on a point, AI may "guess" an answer instead of saying that the information is not there.

**Not knowing New Roc’s internal decisions**  

  AI does not know your internal conversations, approvals, or risk decisions unless you give it that information.

Because of these limits, **AI is not a source of truth**. It is a **drafting and organising tool** that still needs your judgement.

## How we will use AI in this training

In this programme, AI is used in clear, controlled ways that match real work:

- Asking practical questions about training specs and contracts (e.g., submittal requirements, notice periods).  
- Creating summaries, lists, and tables that make long documents easier to work with.  
- Drafting short emails, notes, or log entries that you then review and adjust.

You stay responsible for what is sent, logged, or agreed.  
AI helps you get to a good draft faster.


## Simple safety and responsibility rules

A few plain rules keep AI use safe and professional:

**Protect sensitive information**  

`Do not paste private, confidential, or highly sensitive data` into tools that have not been approved for that type of information.

**Treat outputs as drafts**  

AI answers are starting points, not final answers. Review them just as you would review text from a junior colleague.

**Check important details**  

For anything that could affect cost, time, or risk, read the actual clause, section, or email thread yourself before acting.

**Ask when unsure**  

If something feels off, ask a colleague or manager rather than relying on the AI's wording.

These rules apply across all three sessions, no matter which tool you are using.
