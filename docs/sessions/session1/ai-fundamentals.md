# AI at Work for New Roc

Use AI to move faster through specs, contracts, emails, and logs — **without guessing** and without changing your main tools.

This page is a quick field guide: what AI is good for, where it fails, and the rules we follow so the output is usable on real projects.

!!! warning "The 60-second rule (use every time)"
    - **No reference = not usable.** If it doesn’t point to the clause/section/page, treat it as a draft idea only.
    - **If the document is silent, say “Not stated.”** Do not fill gaps with “typical practice.”
    - **Verify 2–3 items in the PDF** before you reuse, send, or rely on the output.

## Why this matters for New Roc

On most projects, a lot of time goes into reading and re-reading specs, contracts, emails, and logs just to find the few lines that matter.

AI can help you search, summarise, and organise this information faster, while you stay in control of the decisions.

In this training, AI is a helper inside tools you already know (browser, PDF viewer, email, Excel) — not a new system you have to learn from scratch.

## What AI is (in simple words)

AI is a text assistant: you give it text plus a clear task, and it produces a draft answer in words, lists, or tables.

It can be very helpful — and it can also be confidently wrong — so we use it with structure and verification.

**Construction-flavored examples**
- Turn a spec section into a “Spec at a glance” summary you can skim.
- Pull out decisions and open questions from a long email thread.
- Convert rough notes into clear bullets you can paste into minutes or a log.

## What AI is good at

AI is most useful when the task is reading, rephrasing, and structuring text into job-ready outputs.

### Reading and rephrasing
- Summaries such as “Spec at a glance” for a section.
- Simple explanations of clauses in plain language.
- Rewriting emails to be shorter and clearer.

### Structuring information
- Turning parts of a spec into a table (item, section, notes).
- Listing submittals, RFIs, or actions from raw text.
- Grouping similar items together (e.g., similar line items from a takeoff export).

### Drafting first versions
- Draft email updates based on bullet points or a table.
- Draft scope notes or transmittal notes to be checked and edited.
- Draft short summaries for meeting notes or weekly digests.

A practical way to think about it: AI drafts and organises; you review and decide.

## What AI is not good at (and what to do instead)

AI can sound confident even when it is wrong or unsure.

The safer habit is to translate each pitfall into one simple operating rule.

!!! danger "Pitfall: Confident mistakes on details"
    **What it looks like:** wrong numbers, dates, section references, or thresholds.  
    **Do instead:** require references and verify in the PDF before using it.

!!! danger "Pitfall: Mixing old and new information"
    **What it looks like:** mixing revisions, addenda, alternates, or different project versions.  
    **Do instead:** state the exact document/version/section you are using and limit scope to that extract.

!!! danger "Pitfall: Ambiguous or missing information"
    **What it looks like:** the spec is vague or silent, and AI “fills in” the gap.  
    **Do instead:** force “Not stated” and list “Missing inputs needed” for a human follow-up.

!!! danger "Pitfall: Not knowing New Roc’s internal decisions"
    **What it looks like:** AI can’t reflect internal approvals, means-and-methods decisions, or risk calls unless you provide them.  
    **Do instead:** add your internal direction explicitly (or leave it out and escalate to the team).

Because of these limits, AI is not a source of truth — it is a drafting and organising tool that still needs judgement and verification.

## How we will use AI in this training

In this programme, AI is used in clear, controlled ways that match real work.

- Ask practical questions about training specs and contracts (e.g., submittal requirements, notice periods).
- Create summaries, lists, and tables that make long documents easier to work with.
- Draft short emails, notes, or log entries that you then review and adjust.

You stay responsible for what is sent, logged, or agreed; AI helps you get to a good draft faster.

## Safety rules (non‑negotiable)

!!! warning "Safety rules (non‑negotiable)"
    - **Protect sensitive information:** do not paste private, confidential, or highly sensitive data into tools that have not been approved for that type of information.
    - **Treat outputs as drafts:** review AI text like you would review work from a junior colleague.
    - **Check important details:** for anything that could affect cost, time, or risk, read the actual clause/section yourself before acting.
    - **Ask when unsure:** if something feels off, ask a colleague/manager rather than relying on the AI’s wording.

## What’s next

Next is the 5-step prompting pattern we will use throughout the training — a simple checklist for getting useful, verifiable output.

    AI should make your work lighter, not riskier — these fundamentals keep it that way.
