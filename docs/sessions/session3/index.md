# Session 3 – AI for estimating

Use AI to turn bid documents into an estimate-ready **bid form submission package** (scope, products, responsibilities, risks, clarifications) **without guessing** and without changing your main tools.  

In this session we apply the same method from Sessions 1–2 to estimating work: Exhibit A scope, specs/products, general conditions responsibilities (permits / debris / safety), and labor modeling — then we assemble the outputs into one package you can review and submit.

!!! info "Start here (10 minutes)"
    Open the setup page → pick one project document → follow the same workflow: extract → prompt → verify → save. 

!!! warning "Golden rule for Session 3"
    **No reference = not usable.** If the output doesn’t point to the section/page (or table row/field), verify it in the source or treat it as a draft only. 

## The method we will repeat

- Extract: Work from one Exhibit A / spec section / checklist excerpt at a time (not the full book). 
- Prompt: Use the 5-step pattern to demand a deliverable (table/checklist), not a paragraph. 
- Verify: Require references and spot-check 2–3 high-risk items (money / time / scope) in the source before using. 
- Save: Store the verified result where work lives, with a source link and any “Not stated / missing inputs.” 

!!! success "What you should leave with"
    - 1 reusable prompt set (copy/paste) for estimating. 
    - 1 verified set of tables (products list + responsibility matrix + risk/clarifications register). 
    - 1 draft bid form submission package you can review internally and finalize. 

## What you'll be able to do after Session 3

- Build a “products + systems” summary from bid documents with page proof (so you can support what you carried). 
- Turn Exhibit A into a responsibility matrix + risk/clarifications register (what we own, what is unclear, what to ask). 
- Quickly answer “who owns permits, debris, safety?” with citations — and flag anything not stated. 
- Produce a safe labor model output from your inputs (crew, wage rates, production assumptions) without inventing productivity. 
- Assemble the above into a bid form submission package that is organized, checkable, and defendable. 

## What's in this session

- Setup: [Projects + custom instructions](projects.md) 
- Module: [Products + systems summary (with proof)](products-systems.md) 
- Module: [Exhibit A scope → responsibility + risk](exhibit-a-risk.md) 
- Module: [Permits / debris / safety: who owns what](who-owns-what.md) 
- Module: [Labor model (safe estimating prompt)](labor-model.md) 
- Capstone: [Bid form submission package](bid-form-package.md) 

> Fast bid summaries are helpful. Verified bid packages are usable.
