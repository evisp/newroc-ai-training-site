# Contracts – extracting the terms fast

Subcontracts are dense: scope, exhibits, payment rules, schedule requirements, risk clauses, and forms are spread across the agreement and attachments.  

AI can help you extract and organize those terms quickly, but it only stays safe when you keep scope tight and verify the key details in the source. 

!!! warning "Golden rule (use every time)"
    - **No reference = not usable.** If the output doesn’t point to the clause/section/page, treat it as a draft only.   
    - If the contract is silent, write **Not stated** (do not fill gaps with “typical practice”).   
    - Verify 2–3 critical items (cost/time/risk) in the PDF before you rely on the output. 

## Where AI helps

Use AI as a text assistant to draft, structure, and organize contract information into job-ready outputs (tables/checklists) that your team can actually use.   
Don’t use it as a “source of truth” for contract interpretation—AI can sound confident and still be wrong on details, which is why we require proof and verification. 

## What to look for

These are the high-value items to extract and verify early (before work starts, before billing, and before changes happen):

!!! success "1) Scope & exhibits"
    - Scope of work breakdown by line item; responsibilities, inclusions/exclusions, who owns what.  
    - Break down each Exhibit/Attachment (what it is, what it requires, who must act).  
    - Unit rates (what triggers them, measurement rules, backup required).  
    - Schedule of Values expectations (required format, timing, approval owner).

!!! success "2) Commercial terms (money)"
    - Payment terms; retainage; required backup with each pay app.  
    - Change Order and T&M processing; notice requirements; markup rules; approval flow.  
    - Tax status (tax exempt / capital improvement) and any forms required.

!!! success "3) Time & schedule"
    - Duration / milestones; schedule updates; float ownership (if stated).  
    - Working time phasing (hours, sequencing constraints, access windows).  
    - Delay rules (notice timing, allowed remedies, no-damages-for-delay language if present).

!!! success "4) Risk, protection, closeout"
    - Liquidated damages (trigger, rate, caps if any).  
    - Bonds (if required); insurance and COI requirements (limits, additional insured wording, timing).  
    - Warranties (labor/material, special warranty forms, start/end triggers).  

!!! success "5) Compliance & special requirements"
    - Payroll requirements (e.g., certified payroll) and what must be submitted with billing.  
    - Lien waivers; sworn statements; affidavits (what forms, when due, who signs).  
    - LEED / sustainability requirements (submittals, tracking, documentation).  
    - Building/site rules and “rules of engagement” requirements that affect means & methods.

## How to work (safe + fast)

Use the same 5-step prompting pattern as Session 1: Task, Context, Constraints, Output format, Verification.   
Keep scope small (one article or one exhibit at a time), force a structured output (table/checklist), and require clause/page references so you can spot-check quickly. 

!!! tip "Easy operating rhythm"
    Extract one section/exhibit → ask for a usable table → verify 2–3 key facts → save the output with a source link and any “Not stated / missing inputs.” 

## What you should produce

Aim to leave contract review with reusable, shareable artifacts (not a long summary): a “Contract Snapshot” (scope, schedule, payment, change order, risk) plus a “Forms Checklist” (lien waivers, affidavits, tax forms, warranty forms) with where each item came from.   
The next page contains short copy/paste prompts that generate these outputs from a specific subcontract and its exhibits.
