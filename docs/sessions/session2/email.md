# Email – using AI in your inbox

You can use AI to write faster, clearer emails and pull action items from messy threads **without guessing** and without changing your main tools.

This works whether you use AI inside your email platform (Google Workspace / Microsoft 365) or by copying the relevant excerpt into an AI chat tool and pasting the result back into Outlook/Gmail. 

!!! warning "Non‑negotiables"
    - **Treat outputs as drafts.** You are responsible for what is sent. 
    - **Do not invent facts.** If something is missing, write “Not stated” and ask a question.
    - **Verify before sending.** Spot-check dates, quantities, scope statements, and commitments in the original thread. 

## Where AI fits (high level)

AI is best used as a text assistant: it can rephrase, structure, and draft first versions quickly, but it can also be confidently wrong on details. 


## Common tools (Google / Microsoft)

In practice you will see AI in two places: (1) built into your workspace (e.g., Gmail/Docs or Outlook/Word/Teams) and (2) standalone chat tools you use alongside email. 
The principles are the same in both: you provide the context and constraints, request a specific output format, and check the facts before sending. 

!!! success "High-value email use cases"
    Use these when you want speed *and* cleaner communication. 

    - Fast reply drafting: produce a concise response with a clear ask, deadline, and next step (you still review and edit). 
    - Action extraction: turn an email thread into “actions / owner / due date / open questions” you can paste into notes or a tracker. 
    - Status update from bullets: convert rough notes into a clean update email with 3–5 bullets, risks, and decisions needed. [file:2]
    - Tone cleanup: rewrite an email to be shorter, calmer, and more professional while keeping the same meaning (no new commitments). 
    - Meeting follow-up: draft a follow-up email that documents decisions and lists next steps, then verify against the notes/thread. 


## The one habit to keep it safe

Before you send anything drafted by AI, do a “60-second check”:
- Confirm 2–3 key facts in the thread (dates, scope, commitments, attachments mentioned). 
- If the thread is silent, force “Not stated” and ask a clarifying question instead of guessing.
