# Session 2 – AI for contracts, specs, and safety

Use AI to turn long project documents into job‑ready outputs (tables, checklists, trackers) **without guessing** and without changing your main tools. 

In this session we apply the same method from Session 1 to three high-value document types (contracts, specifications, and safety plans), plus a short email module for faster, clearer communication. 

!!! info "Start here (10 minutes)"
    Skim the templates → pick one use case → follow the same workflow: extract → prompt → verify → save. 

!!! warning "Golden rule for Session 2"
    **No reference = not usable.** If the output doesn't point to the clause/section/page, verify it in the PDF or treat it as a draft only.

## The method we will repeat

- Extract: Work from one contract/spec/safety excerpt at a time (not the full book). 
- Prompt: Use the 5-step pattern to demand a deliverable (table/checklist), not a paragraph. 
- Verify: Require references and spot-check 2–3 items in the source PDF before using or sending. 
- Save: Store the verified result where work lives, with a source link and any “Not stated / missing inputs.” 

!!! success "What you should leave with"
    - 1 reusable prompt (copy/paste) for your role. 
    - 1 verified output (table/checklist) tied to clause/section/page references. 
    - 1 saved note that includes the prompt, output, and source link so it can be reused. 

## What you'll be able to do after Session 2

- Break down a contract into a “contract intake” checklist + red flags (change order, payment/retainage, schedule, LDs, bonds/COI, exhibits/forms).
- Turn relevant spec sections into an Excel-ready submittal log and requirement list (materials, mockups/samples, tests/inspections, warranties, timelines). 
- Draft a JHA / pre-task plan hazard-mitigation matrix from a task description and uploaded safety inputs. 

## What's in this session

- Templates: [Good vs bad prompts](../../prompts/index.md) 
- Email module: [Fast replies + action extraction](email.md) 
- Use case: [Contract intake checklist + red flags](contracts.md) 
- Use case: [Spec → Submittal log (Excel-ready)](specs-submittals.md) 
- Use case: [JHA / Pre-task plan hazards + mitigations](jha-pretask.md)
