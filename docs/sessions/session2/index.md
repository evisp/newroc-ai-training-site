# Session 2 – Documents to Data: Excel tables + clear emails

The goal of this session is to help you turn messy project information (PDFs, exports, markups, notes) into clean Excel tables and clear emails, without changing your main tools. 

You'll see how to extract structured data from a long document, clean it fast in Excel, verify a few rows against the source, and then draft a short project update email that is accurate and easy to act on. 

**Start here (10 minutes):** Learn the workflow → watch the demo → try one lab.

## What you’ll be able to do after Session 2

- Extract selected pages/sections from a PDF or export into a copy‑paste‑ready table for Excel.  
- Clean and validate the table (units, formats, basic checks) and spot‑check 2–3 rows against the source before using it.  
- Draft a short status/coordination email from the cleaned table (subject + 3 key bullets + clear asks).  
- Save an "evidence pack" note with the source link and the prompt used so your output is traceable.  

## What's in this session

- The workflow we'll use: [Extract → Clean → Check → Email](workflow.md)  
- How it looks in practice: [Live demo](demos.md)  
- Time to try it yourself: [Practice & exercises](exercises.md)  
- Templates to reuse: [Checklists & email scaffolds](templates.md)  

> Clean tables plus clear emails reduce rework and speed up every handoff.
