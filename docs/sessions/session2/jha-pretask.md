# JHA / Pre‑Task Plans – faster, clearer, verifiable

JHAs and Pre‑Task Plans work best when they are specific to the activity, easy to review in the field, and consistent day to day.  
AI can help you turn methods/sequence notes into a clean hazard + mitigation table and a sign‑off roster, while you keep ownership of the final safety decision. 

!!! warning "Golden rule (use every time)"
    - **Treat outputs as drafts.** A competent person must review before use.  
    - **No reference = not usable.** If it doesn’t point to the source excerpt, treat it as a draft idea only.  
    - If the source is silent, write **Not stated** and list missing inputs.  
    - Verify 2–3 critical items (high-risk steps) against the original method/sequence before sharing in the field. 

## Where AI helps

AI is strongest at restructuring messy text into job-ready outputs: tables, checklists, and short plain-language bullets. 
For JHAs, that means you can paste a method statement / sequencing note and get a draft hazard-control table instead of writing from scratch every time. 

## Inputs that work well

The best inputs are short, activity-specific documents (or excerpts) that describe **how** the work will be done.  
For example, an installation MOP that includes layout steps, drilling/anchoring steps, cure times, torque checks, and verification steps is exactly the type of text that can be converted into a Pre‑Task Plan structure. 

## What a good output looks like

A good AI-generated JHA draft should produce three practical pieces you can reuse:

!!! success "1) Activity-based hazard + mitigation table"
    One row per activity step (e.g., layout, drilling, epoxy install, installation/torque/verification). 
    Each row includes: location/area, hazards, controls/mitigations, PPE, and a “Proof” reference back to the pasted excerpt. 

!!! success "2) Competent person / roles references"
    A short table listing the key roles you need identified for the task (e.g., competent person, foreman, operator roles), with “TBD” placeholders if the source doesn’t name them.   

!!! success "3) Sign‑off roster concept"
    A simple sign‑off roster table (e.g., 50 lines) that can later be turned into a fillable PDF in your standard form tool. 

## How to work (safe + fast)

Use the same 5-step prompting pattern you’ve used for specs/contracts: Task, Context, Constraints, Output format, Verification. 
Keep scope tight: one activity (or one excerpt) at a time, so the output stays specific and checkable. 

!!! tip "Best practice"
    Start from the method/sequence notes you already have, generate the draft tables, then do a quick field review and finalize in your standard JHA form.
