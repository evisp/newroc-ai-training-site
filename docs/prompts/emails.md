## Email prompt templates

These are quick “copy/paste” prompts for email work.   
Keep them short, and keep the rule the same: AI drafts, you verify, you send. 

!!! tip "How to use these"
    Copy the **Good prompt**, paste the relevant email excerpt (or doc excerpt), and then do a 60‑second check on dates/scope/commitments before sending.

??? example "1) Smart email composing (draft reply)"
    **Goal:** Draft a clear, professional reply that’s short and action-oriented. 

    === "Bad prompt (don’t use)"
        ```text
        Reply to this email.
        ```

        !!! warning "Why this fails"
            - Too vague, so the reply is generic and easy to misread. 
            - Higher risk of accidental commitments or wrong details. 

    === "Good prompt (copy/paste)"
        ```text
        Draft a concise reply to the email below (max 120 words) for a PM/Super audience.
        Keep it professional and include one clear next step + one direct question if something is missing.
        Use only what’s stated in the thread - do not invent dates, scope, or commitments.
        ```

??? example "2) Long email thread → summary + action points"
    **Goal:** Turn a messy thread into a job-ready summary + action list. 

    === "Bad prompt (don’t use)"
        ```text
        Summarize this email thread.
        ```

        !!! warning "Why this fails"
            - You usually get a narrative summary, not a usable action list. 
            - Missing owners/due dates makes it hard to track. 

    === "Good prompt (copy/paste)"
        ```text
        Convert the email thread below into a 5-bullet summary plus an action list (Action | Owner | Due date | Open question).
        If owner or due date is not stated, write “TBD” or “Not stated.”
        Use only the thread text—no assumptions.
        ```

??? example "3) Pull facts from a document into an email draft (with proof)"
    **Goal:** Insert accurate facts from a document excerpt into an email, without guessing. 

    === "Bad prompt (don’t use)"
        ```text
        Read this PDF and write an email about it.
        ```

        !!! warning "Why this fails"
            - Too broad and encourages guessing or mixing the wrong sections/versions. 
            - No proof: hard to verify what’s real in the document. 

    === "Good prompt (copy/paste)"
        ```text
        Using ONLY the document excerpt below, draft a short email I can send (max 150 words) and include 3 key facts as bullets.
        After each bullet, add the section/page label from the excerpt as proof.
        If the excerpt doesn’t state something I need, write “Not stated” and ask a clear question.
        ```


### Remember: AI can help you write faster, but it’s not the sender - you are. 

- Keep scope tight: paste only the relevant part of the thread or document excerpt. 
- Don’t guess: if it isn’t stated, write **Not stated** and ask a clear question. 
- Verify before sending: spot-check dates, scope statements, and commitments in the original source.
